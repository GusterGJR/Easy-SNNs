# Easy-SNNs
An SNNs code for beginners, just need to adjust some parameters and expand the database.

Easy_SNNs_for_Upload.py is the main part of the project, while parameters.py contains all the parameters that can be changed in the model.
So for users, just need to adjust the parameters and run the program.

But remember, if you change the variable "seconds", then simultaneously "input_size", "hidden_size" also need to be changed according to the matrix inside.
